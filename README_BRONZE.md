## Overview
This is the Bronze Tier implementation of the Autonomous AI Employee system. It provides basic automation capabilities with one watcher, Claude Code integration, and file-based task management.

## Features
- ✅ File system watcher for automatic task creation
- ✅ Claude Code integration for task processing
- ✅ Obsidian vault as knowledge base and dashboard
- ✅ Basic human-in-the-loop approval system
- ✅ Automated logging and monitoring
- ✅ Skill-based task execution

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup_bronze.py

2. Configure environment variables:
- Edit C:/Users/manal/OneDrive/Desktop/Hacakthon 0/.env
- Add your Claude API key and other credentials

3. Start the system:
# Terminal 1 - Start file watcher
python filesystem_watcher.py

# Terminal 2 - Start orchestrator
python orchestrator.py

4. Test the system:
- Drop a file in AI_Employee_Vault/Drop_Folder/
- Watch Claude process it automatically
- Check Dashboard.md for updates

## Available Skills:
The system can use skills from C:\Users\manal\OneDrive\Desktop\Hacakthon 0\.claude\skills:
- file_processor: Read and write files
- text_analyzer: Analyze text content
- task_planner: Create detailed task plans
- email_drafter: Draft email responses
- data_extractor: Extract structured data

## How It Works:
1. Detection: File watcher monitors Drop_Folder
2. Task Creation: Creates .md file in Needs_Action
3. Processing: Orchestrator triggers Claude to process
4. Planning: Claude creates plan in /Plans/
5. Approval: If needed, creates approval request
6. Execution: After approval, actions are taken
7. Completion: Files moved to /Done/, dashboard updated

## Bronze Tier Requirements Met:
- One watcher script (File System Watcher)
- Basic task processing with Claude Code
- One MCP server (filesystem built-in)
- Dashboard.md updates automatically
- All AI functionality as Agent Skills
- Human-in-the-loop for approvals

## Next Steps (Silver Tier):
- Add Gmail and WhatsApp watchers
- Implement email sending via MCP
- Add scheduling capabilities
- Create LinkedIn automation
- Enhance approval workflows
